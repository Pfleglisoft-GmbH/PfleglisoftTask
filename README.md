Task:

The Management dashboard consists of the following three key performance indexes (c.f. kpis.png) for the entire company:

1. Customer winning rate
2. Order fulfillment
3. Customer satisfaction

Regarding the customer satisfaction: After care has been provided successfully the customer (relative of the patient) is getting a feedback form and has to rate the following 5 criterias:

1. basic care
2. household supply
3. communication
4. visual appearance
5. (subjective) overall rating

All the 5 criterias can get as values numbers from 0 to 5 in 0.5 steps. So a valuation as 3.5 should be possible.
Calculate out of these values an objective overall rating in %.
